# Quick email

A small app to e-mail a snippet of text to one of the Google accounts associated with an Android phone.

## Motivation

I find I send a lot of reminder e-mails to myself - this app just saves a few clicks. It does nothing more than sends the entered text to the e-mail address of one of your accounts.
